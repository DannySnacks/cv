                    <p>Dan Rawdon was born on Long Island, New York in 1995. During his childhood Dan was always a fan of video games that he would play on consoles, desktop and on his Gameboy Color. In 2006 he moved to Atlanta, Georgia and began spending more time outside socializing. It wasn't until his studies at Kennesaw State University that his interest in technology was rekindled. Since graduating from KSU in 2017, Dan has spent his professional career building and operating technologies in businesses. In December 2022, Dan decided to finally take the leap and learn how to code.</p></td>
